// Global object....
// The global object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere. 
// By default, those that are built into the language or the environment.

// In a browser, global functions and variables declared with var (not let/const!) become the property of the global object:
var gVar = "global";
console.log(window.gVar);

//if we use Let instead of var keyword it will give an error (undefined)...
//because let keyword is not allowd in global object....
let language = "JS"
console.log(window.language); 

// If a data is so important that youâ€™d like to make it available globally, write it directly as a property:
// make current user information global, to let all scripts access it.
window.userInfo = {
    name : "ayaad",
    faculty : "CS"
}

// or, if we have a local variable with the name "userInfo"
// use window keyword berfore use..
alert(window.userInfo.name); // ayaad
